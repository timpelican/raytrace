Feature: Transformations

As a programmer
I want to define transformations using matrices
So I can transform 3d objects

Scenario: Multiplying by a translation matrix
  Given transform <- translation(5, -3, 2)
  And p <- point(-3, 4, 5)
  Then transform * p = point(2, 1, 7)

Scenario: Multiplying by the inverse of a translation matrix
  Given transform <- translation(5, -3, 2)
  And inv <- inverse(transform)
  And p <- point(-3, 4, 5)
  Then inv * p = point(-8, 7, 3)

Scenario: Translation does not affect vectors
  Given transform <- translation(5, -3, 2)
  And v <- vector(-3, 4, 5)
  Then transform * v = vector v

Scenario: A scaling matrix applied to a point
  Given transform <- scaling(2, 3, 4)
  And p <- point(-4, 6, 8)
  Then transform * p = point(-8, 18, 32)

Scenario: A scaling matrix applied to a vector
  Given transform <- scaling(2, 3, 4)
  And v <- vector(-4, 6, 8)
  Then transform * v = vector(-8, 18, 32)

Scenario: Multiplying by the inverse of a scaling matrix
  Given transform <- scaling(2, 3, 4)
  And inv <- inverse(transform)
  And v <- vector(-4, 6, 8)
  Then inv * v = vector(-2, 2, 2)

Scenario: Reflection is scaling by a negative value
  Given transform <- scaling(-1, 1, 1)
  And p <- point(2, 3, 4)
  Then transform * p = point(-2, 3, 4)
