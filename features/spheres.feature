Feature: Spheres

As a programmer
I want to work with spheres
So I can build objects

Scenario: A ray intersects a sphere at two points
  Given r <- ray(point(0, 0, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
  And s <- sphere()
  When xs <- intersect(s, r)
  Then xs.count = 2
  And xs[0].t = 4.0
  And xs[1].t = 6.0

Scenario: A ray intersects a sphere at a tangent
  Given r <- ray(point(0, 1, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
  And s <- sphere()
  When xs <- intersect(s, r)
  Then xs.count = 2
  And xs[0].t = 5.0
  And xs[1].t = 5.0

Scenario: A ray misses a sphere
  Given r <- ray(point(0, 2, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
  And s <- sphere()
  When xs <- intersect(s, r)
  Then xs.count = 0

Scenario: A ray originates inside a sphere
  Given r <- ray(point(0, 0, 0), vector(0, 0, 1))
  And s <- sphere()
  When xs <- intersect(s, r)
  Then xs.count = 2
  And xs[0].t = -1.0
  And xs[1].t = 1.0

Scenario: A sphere is behind a ray
  Given r <- ray(point(0, 0, 5), vector(0, 0, 1))
  And s <- sphere()
  When xs <- intersect(s, r)
  Then xs.count = 2
  And xs[0].t = -6.0
  And xs[1].t = -4.0

Scenario: Intersect sets the object on the intersection
  Given r <- ray(point(0, 0, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
  And s <- sphere()
  When xs <- intersect(s, r)
  Then xs.count = 2
  And xs[0].object = s
  And xs[1].object = s

Scenario: A sphere's default transformation
  Given s <- sphere()
  Then s.transform is the identity_matrix

Scenario: Changing a sphere's transformation
  Given s <- sphere()
  And t <- translation(2, 3, 4)
  When set_transform(s, t)
  Then s.transform = t

Scenario: Intersecting a scaled sphere with a ray
  Given r <- ray(point(0, 0, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
  And s <- sphere()
  And t <- scaling(2, 2, 2)
  When set_transform(s, t)
  And xs <- intersect(s, r)
  Then xs.count = 2
  And xs[0].t = 3
  And xs[1].t = 7

Scenario: Intersecting a translated sphere with a ray
  Given r <- ray(point(0, 0, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
  And s <- sphere()
  And t <- translation(5, 0, 0)
  When set_transform(s, t)
  And xs <- intersect(s, r)
  Then xs.count = 0
